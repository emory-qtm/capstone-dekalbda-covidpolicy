# Motivation
This project describes the process undergone to analyze the Office of the DeKalb County District Attorney’s (ODDA) Policy Regarding Case Backlog Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The policy expanded the criteria for non-violent felonies eligible for dismissal and pretrial diversion to include certain drug, forgery, theft, financial crime and burglary charges. Using data sets provided by the ODDA, outside recidivism data from Vera Incarceration Trends and demographic data from the American Community Survey from the United States Census Bureau, we analyzed how the policy impacted the DeKalb County community as it pertains to Prosecutorial Performance Indicators and best-practice recidivist metrics, specifically the recidivism rate within DeKalb county and the severity of recidivist crimes. In particular, we focus on case processing efficiency, re-offender information and potential demographic disparities. The results will be helpful for identifying any weaknesses or strengths present in the policy guidelines and inform any future decisions concerning its continuance or termination.
# Partners of Project
We collaborated with [Office of the DeKalb County District Attorney](https://www.dekalbda.org/) for this project. Office of the DeKalb County District Attorney is the prosecutor agency representing Georgia State in Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit.

For this project, Office of the DeKalb County District Attorney has provided us guidelines, legal aid, prosecution-related data from the DeKalb District Attorney jurisdiction, and feedback to our analysis to account for an accurate representation of impact of the ODDA's Policy Regarding Case Backlog Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
# Intended Use of Project
A typical user of this Github repository should have interest in the following:
- learn the recidivism of the convicted through data from DeKalb County District Attorney’s jurisdiction
- understand how to apply satistical inference in recidivism analysis
- explore the impact of government intervention on recidivism

This repository is designed to help Python and R users to analyze and visualize the recidivism in DeKalb County District Attorney’s jurisdiction.
## Use of Data Sources
The data used in this project is provided and permitted by Office of the DeKalb County District Attorney, which shall not be displayed on any public device and space and shall not remain on any personal computer after the project is finished. Therefore, this Github repository will not display or store the data.
# Setup
This section instructs the user how to prepare necessary tools and environment for replicate our research.

These notebooks were created by Claire Fenton, Annie Luo, and Feiyu Xiang,. This project wouldn't have been possible without the support from Dr. Blake Fleischer, Office of DeKalb County District Attorney, and Emory University QTM Department. These notebooks were built using the R and Python statistical program.
